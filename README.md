# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose

We are tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.  We have access to datasets containing reviews of a specific product type, and after selecting one of these datasets we are using the ETL process to extract the data, transform it, and then load it into an AWS RDS instance.  After that we are determining if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in the chosen dataset.

## Results

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary

In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
